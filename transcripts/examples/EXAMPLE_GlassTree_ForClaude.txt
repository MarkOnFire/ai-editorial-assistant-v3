1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:04,338
[gentle piano and bell music]

2
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,719
- Jason Mack: What stands
36 feet tall,

3
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:23,624
17 foot wide at the base, has
3,000 pounds of glass on it?

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,929
[bright bell and string music]

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,798
There's nothing else like it.

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,668
It's kind of my own invention.

7
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,937
My name is Jason Mack,

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,840
creator of the world's
tallest glass tree.

9
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,242
You really can't ask for a
better backdrop

10
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,446
for the glass tree
than Yerkes Observatory.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,057
- Attendee: Really cool.
- Jason: Thank you!

12
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,194
When the community comes
to the event,

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,495
they actually have
the opportunity

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,131
to put the glass on the tree.

15
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,434
And you're gonna take another
step closer to the tree.

16
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:12,206
And then you're gonna let the
glass drip down to the tree.

17
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,142
We gather the glass out of the
furnace on a gathering iron,

18
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,145
and we gather, you know,
about two pounds at a time.

19
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,948
And just let the glass drip off
the end of the pipe,

20
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,151
and then the tree
takes it around.

21
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,421
All the glass that we use
to create the tree

22
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,556
is donated by the community.

23
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,391
There's a nice blue one
right there.

24
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,962
That's what we're looking for.
[glass shattering]

25
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,264
We crush it up, shovel it
in the furnace.

26
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,801
[furnace roaring]
[glass clanking]

27
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,803
- Wow!
- Yeah,

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,372
so that's 2,000 degrees
in there.

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,574
So you can see it
when I dip the pipe in,

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,576
it's just kind of like dipping
a honeycomb stick

31
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,311
into a jar of honey.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,718
You can take a step closer and
go a little higher if you want.

33
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,155
We add glass to it for about
seven to eight days.

34
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:08,028
It takes about 3,000 pounds of
glass to really cover the frame.

35
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,101
The star is five feet
in diameter.

36
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,736
Placing the star onto the tree

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,206
is kind of a nail-biting
process, honestly.

38
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,909
So we're lifting it up almost
50 feet off the ground

39
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,911
to make room
to drop the star on.

40
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,781
Slow, slow, all right,
a little bit more.

41
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,551
Plus, we're doing it in front
of hundreds of people

42
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,885
as they watch.

43
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,488
The tree itself is 31 feet,
and then

44
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,690
once we put the five-foot
blown glass star on it,

45
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,560
it reaches a height of 36 feet.

46
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,162
[crowd cheering]

47
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,337
One question I get a lot is,

48
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,472
"What do you do with the tree
after Christmas?"

49
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,809
We pull all the glass
off the steel frame,

50
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,344
and I remelt that glass,

51
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,181
and I make about a thousand
small spun glass trees.

52
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,349
So, that's one thing.

53
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,618
I love the whole life cycle
of this project,

54
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,087
how you're building something
and then you're tearing it down,

55
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,022
and then you're building
something new with it.

56
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,225
Here you go, step on up.

57
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,193
Hold it up in the air.

58
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,732
I hope people get a sense of
inspiration from this project.

59
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,001
I'm really kind of fortunate

60
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,070
that this project
has really struck a chord,

61
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:28,208
and it's been a fun ride
with this one sculpture idea.

62
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,744
I'm doing what I love to do.

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,713
[bright music]
